Emacs minor mode for [[http://www.retrosoftware.co.uk/wiki/index.php/BeebAsm][BeebAsm]] by Rich Talbot-Watkins. Tested with
emacs 25.

To install, =require= it from your .emacs, and add a suitable entry to
=auto-mode-alist=. For example:

: (require 'beebasm-mode)
: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.6502$" . beebasm-mode))

It's not especially clever. Just supports some basic stuff: font lock,
syntax table, compilation error regexp, imenu.

It might not be of general interest, but I have [[https://github.com/tom-seddon/beebasm/tree/_tom][my own fork of
beebasm]].
